        I love coding, biking and my wife(i guess i have to add this since she might read
        this. coding is my everyday thing but when i get stressed and cant figure it out,
        i road-bike from West Valley to Salt lake, either check out the canyon and tire
        myself out. i ebike too when i get bored. i like smelling the wind breeze, and the
        plants it make my stress goes away.
